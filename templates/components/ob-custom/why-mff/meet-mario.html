		</div>

		<p>In 2018 MyFitFoods was re-started for several reasons</p>

<p>You deserve the best</p>

<p>We all need a place to eat where the food is healthy, tasty, and affordable.  A place where the staff cares about our health and fitness even when we don't. A place where the service was so good, you feel compelled to talk about it.  As a former personal trainer, this was the place of my dreams.</p>

<p>The older you get the harder it is to stay healthy. Staying fit, keeping the fat off and even fat loss is not easy and even harder to maintain long-term.  It would be best to have a good coach, good food, and accountability for the best results. Myself and the team have made the preventative side of healthy affordable and that’s how it should be. </p>

<p>MyFitLife</p>

<p>I had my nutritional world flipped upside down by a Ph.D. named Dr. House.  Learning the most up-to-date studies researched by a team of Ph.D.'s has been eye-opening, and I can't wait to share MyFitLife with you.  The 21 Day Challenge was an awesome way to kick start a change.  MyFitLife has turned into the natural evolution of the 21DC.  We need a good coach to keep us focused on getting you to your goals and keeping them long-term.  Fat loss, muscle gain, increased energy levels let us where you want to be.  Then let's make it happen!</p>

<p>BFF’s aka Best Fit Friends</p>

<p>If you need additional fitness help, our BFF's - Best Fit Friends will make sure you get what you need to be your healthiest.  When it comes to fitness professionals, we work with and are supported by the very best.  We take care of our BFF's, and all we ask in return is that they take good care of you.</p>

<p>Employees should have a great workplace</p>

<p>Employees deserve a workplace where respect and dignity are commonplace and this weighed heavily on the recreation of MyFitFoods.  The pay should be fair, profits shared, and the benefits generous.  We provide employees with leadership focused on growing their minds, feeding their souls, and creating hope for future growth.  At MFF we work hard every day, we love what we do, and that's taking care of you and each other.</p>

<p>MyFitFoods and Give A Fit</p>

<p>It was important to position the company to be able to take care of people in need.  For every four meals purchased at MFF, we donate one meal to various local and national non-profits that provide people and families in need.  That makes should make all of us proud, yourself included, as you are a crucial part of the team. Our company tag-line "GIVE A FIT" says it all.  Join our fit family, and let's do the right thing by supporting those in need.</p>

<p>Starting, failing and getting up again</p>

<p>It was hard starting MFF V1 from the ground up.  It was hard watching MyFitFoods being ran by a different management team, being kicked out of the company I started and watching all the original core values disappear. I was kicked out of MFF several years before it ultimately closed the doors and went bankrupt.  I can’t tell you how badly I wanted my old name back and luckily, I managed to purchase it back from the bankruptcy courts in 2019. I had a second chance to make sure my baby, could do what she was meant to do.</p>

<p>Failure is never final. When you have a hard time in life, your fate is in your hands.  Take ownership, learn, grow and get on with it.

<p>Re-starting from scratch a  second time was incredibly hard. I’d like to thank a few good people here.  Nick Travaille, Aaron Persels, Tim Watson, Aaron Dorland, Ben Thompson, Charles Mercer, Antony Proctor, Tyler Harris, Lisa Drew and Justin Williams. You all have been as dedicated, if not more dedicated to MyFitFoods than me.  Thank you.</p>

<p>This time around, MFF is being done the right way with the right intentions and with the right fitness minded people. I asked myself what would make me happy in life. To work with the right team who were dedicated to serving and taking care of people.  It is with this mindset the entire team approaches life at MyFitFoods. We give our all to you.
</p>
<p>MyFitFoods is here to be there for you and that is why I re-founded MyFitFoods.  It has been really hard, but it has also been 100% worth it.  We all need a company we can trust, people who look out for our health, and people who have our well-being in mind.  We are here for you, and we are MyFitFoods.</p>

<p>See you around,</p>

<p>Mario M<br>
Founder<br>
MyFitFoods</p>
