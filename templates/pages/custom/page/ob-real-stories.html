I followed the program faithfully and found it very easy to do.  The first thing I noticed was that I was never hungry; in fact, I ate more than ever.  I felt better immediately and consistently lost weight. I look and feel great, have more energy for my workouts, and sleep more soundly!  Plus the food is delicious, I look forward to every meal.  Having a sweet snack in my day means I’m no longer scrounging around for sweet treats at home….and I have a big sweet tooth!  It has truly changed my life!”

However, after I started the plan of eating 2400 calories a day along with the preplanned foods, I started losing fat and gaining more muscle. The food is very delicious and if you stick with the plan, you will see results. Special thanks to Lizzy for keeping me motivated throughout the process and making it easy to stay on track.
