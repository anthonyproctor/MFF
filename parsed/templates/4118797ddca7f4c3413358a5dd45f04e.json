You pay $10 a month and save 20% on all of your MFF purchases and can cancel any time you want.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"faq-toggles\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"section\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"ob-heading-sm\">IS THIS A CONTRACT?</h3>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>We absolutely agree, it does sound too good to be true. But the truth is there is no catch. The Fit Club allows us to provide a win-win for our loyal MFF family by providing you a substantial discount that gives our business just a tad more certainty every month.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"faq-toggles\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"section\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"ob-heading-sm\">IS THERE A MONTHLY LIMIT ON SAVINGS?</h3>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Nope. We don’t cap your monthly spend or once you reach a certain amount of savings because that would just not be cool. You can literally buy as much MFF snacks and meals as your belly desires and it’s all 👏🏼 twenty 👏🏼 percent 👏🏼 off 👏🏼.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\n"
